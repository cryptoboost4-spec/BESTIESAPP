## ❓ FAQ Page

### General Questions

**Q: Is Besties really free?**
A: Yes! All core safety features are free forever. We offer optional SMS subscriptions ($1/month) and donations to support development, but you never have to pay.

**Q: How does it work?**
A: Create a check-in with a timer and location. If you don't check in safely by the timer, your besties get automatic alerts.

**Q: Who can I add as a bestie?**
A: Anyone you trust - friends, family, roommates. They'll receive alerts if you don't check in.

**Q: Do my besties need the app?**
A: No! They can receive alerts via SMS, email, or WhatsApp even without the app.

**Q: What if I forget to check in?**
A: Your besties will get progressive alerts (10min, 5min, 1min, 30sec). Just tap "I'm Safe" when you remember, or they can mark it as a false alarm.

### Safety Questions

**Q: Is this a replacement for 911?**
A: No! Besties is a safety tool, not emergency services. In a true emergency, always call 911 or local emergency services immediately.

**Q: What if my phone dies?**
A: Your besties will still get alerts when your check-in timer expires. They can check on you.

**Q: Can I use this for tracking?**
A: Besties is designed for safety check-ins, not continuous tracking. Location is only shared during active check-ins.

**Q: What if I'm in a dangerous situation?**
A: Besties can help, but always prioritize calling 911. The app can notify your besties, but emergency services are faster.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need internet?**
A: You need internet to create check-ins, but alerts will still be sent even if your phone goes offline (once the timer expires).

**Q: What devices work?**
A: Besties works on any device with a web browser (phone, tablet, computer). Native apps coming soon!

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes! We use Firebase (Google) security, end-to-end encryption, and never sell your data. See our Privacy Policy for details.

**Q: Can I delete my account?**
A: Yes! Go to Settings > Delete Account. All your data will be permanently deleted within 30 days.

### Payment Questions

**Q: Do I have to pay?**
A: No! Core features are free forever. SMS subscriptions and donations are optional.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes! Cancel SMS subscriptions or donations anytime in Settings. No questions asked.

**Q: What happens if I cancel?**
A: You keep all free features. You just won't get SMS alerts (but push notifications still work).
